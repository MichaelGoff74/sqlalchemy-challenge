# sqlalchemy-challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

Create a new repository for this project called sqlalchemy-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as SurfsUp.

Add your Jupyter notebook and app.py to this folder. Theyâ€™ll contain the main scripts to run for analysis. Also add the Resources folder, which contains the data files you will be using for this challenge.

Push the changes to GitHub or GitLab.
